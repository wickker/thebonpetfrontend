        Our meals are delivered through cold-chain delivery, ensuring they

    question: 'How do I transition my pet to The Bon Pet meals?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        We recommend a gradual transition, especially if your pet is currently
        on a kibble diet. Start by mixing a small portion of our meals with
        their current food and increase the ratio over 3–5 days. Monitor your
        pet's stool throughout the process. If you encounter any issues or have
        concerns, feel free to contact us on WhatsApp for tailored advice.

    question: 'Can I cook or heat your meals?',

        room temperature for the best experience.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'How should I store the meals once thawed?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        Thawed meals should be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator
        and consumed within 2–3 days. Do not refreeze once thawed, as this can
        compromise the food's quality and safety.

    question: 'Are your meals raw or cooked?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        Our meals are prepared sous vide, a method that cooks the food gently to

        ensures that your pet gets the best of both worlds: the benefits of raw
        food with the safety of cooked meals.
